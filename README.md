### Closed-Stack-Overflow-Questions-Kaggle
- This is my solution for the [Predict Closed Questions on Stack Overflow](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-closed-questions-on-stack-overflow) on Kaggle.
- The dataset is composed of text data and meta data about the question.
- I have performed some feature engineering and used a multi-input neural network to process text and meta data seperately.
- The notebook is run on Kaggle kernel and I have only used a small section of the actual training dataset because the actual dataset is large and kaggle kernels don't provide enough computing resources.
- The solution is just to demonstrate the workflow of a typical NLP problem and is in no way an optimized solution.
